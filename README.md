# Explanation:
Intended to replace the vanilla c0000.chresd.dcx file in your DSR's chr folder. Works with modengine too of course, if you use that. This should make for a good base for anyone wanting to dive into chresd editing. Use with Zeditor. Normally I'd link the github page for it, but I can't recommend the one on github, as it's out of date; please save yourself so much trouble and download the more updated "Nightfall" version Meowmaritus posted on the ?ServerName? Discord. Trust me, you would rather use that one. Back up your changes frequently though, as I've encountered saving corruptions before.

YouTube tutorial on ESD editing to come soon. I will probably just go over some of the basics like how to extend attack strings, and maybe how to add new item/spell animations.

# Note:
Use at your own risk! I did all of this manually, so it is prone to human error. I was however very careful only to remove/merge conditions I deemed redundant or useless. I kept many of the unused states and labeled them as such, but you're free to delete them if you'd like.

****KNOWN BUGS IN OLDER VERSION****:
- Drinking estus puts you into an infinite loop lol oops (linked some conditions by accident)
- R2 As don't go to R2 Bs

^ These bugs shouldn't be an issue with the latest one I uploaded. Read that commit's comments for more info.
